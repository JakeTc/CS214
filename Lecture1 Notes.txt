ssh jt919@less.cs.rutgers.edu <--- gets you onto ilab machine
Need ssh client --> putty or secure shell client

X2GO <-- dont use this, slow unreliable, login limit

two major text editors: emacs or vi

Question Asking
0. What do you think the problem is?
1. What have you done so far?

Why C?

C: compile(source)...
	compile ... link ... assenble ---> executable
	source --> executable

Java: javac(source)...
	compile ... <magic> ---> bytecode
	java bytecodeName <--- this is how you run the code on a terminal
	source --> bytecode
	bytecode --> commands

compiler for C
gcc <sourcecodename.c>
to run, use command ./a.out

"." <-- use dot command to refer to "this" code

gcc test.c -o test <--- compiles and creates executable
./test <---runs the file

Care and use of your C. code
0. Always return something!!!!
1. Always initialize everything(!!) (ex. set ints to 0 and strings to 'a')

There are no methods in C, only programs and functions


terminal commands
ls <-- list of all files
ls test* <-- looks for any programs that start with test and end with anything
ls test.c <-- searches for this file

blue text is generally all directories

cd tmp <-- goes into tmp directory
using ls command in a directory searches the directory

cd .. <-- goes back one directory chain
pwd <-- "print working directory", will tell you where you are right now. Will show you the file from root
cd ~ <-- takes you to home directory

rm <filename> <-- removes file name. BE CAREFUL!!!

quick key, press the first few letters and hit tab twice. mess around with tab


int
char
String(kinda no)
float
double
short
long
boolean(nope) <-- value 0 = false, every other value is true
	(can use enum to get boolean values)

C is a memory oriented language. 

Act of assinging a value itself has a return value!!!!
int a = 3; <-- this returns the value 3

char a = 'a';
a = 52; <-- return value of this statement is 1 because
