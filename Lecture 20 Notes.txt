IO
	open - get a fd
	close - get rid of a fd
	read - get bytes from a fd
	write - give bytes to a fd
	
	open(<name>, <flags>); <--if you plan to read/wr from an existing file
	
	//if you plan to create a file
	open(<name>, <flags>, <mode>);
	flags: at the minimum, will say how you plan to interact with the file
		O_RDWR | O_CREAT <---bitwise or to combine flags together
	mode: permissions on the new file. <--only for if you are creating a new file
	
create

lseek

atoi --> char array to integer

directory chains: relative vs absolute
	relative: ./<pathfromheretodesiredfile>
	absolute: starts at root (or /) and continues from there
	
fd- identify some IO resource/endpoint
	fh (file handle)- cursor/position in the resource(not always present, but
		definitely there for files)

lseek: how to update the fh
	-can make the file bigger, lseek to end + some more, and write something there
	-if you lseek to the end of a file, lseek will return how long the file is
