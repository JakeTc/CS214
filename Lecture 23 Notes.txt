Last Project of the Year!
DUMB using DUMB protocol

rand num between 4096 and 65536 == port number! maybe use something random, like 36276
when getting a connection request, makes a new thread to handle that client
the thread stays with the client for the entire session until client wants to quit.

client side will converse w/ user
	user types in commands and client converts this to prtcl
	client then send this to server
	server gives response
	client interprets response and gives it to user

	HELLO
		when client starts up, immediately connects by sending "HELLO"

INITIALLY SET IT UP WITH FILE DESCRIPTORS AND NOT SOCKETS
ALLOWS YOU TO TEST IT

INITIALLY READ A COMMAND AND EXECUTE IT W/O PARALLELISM

	directly connected
	store & forward
		either send to target, or send to machine closest to client
		closest determined by if their ip has the best match to target ip
