Sockets:
	File Descriptor for communicating with another machine (send data to the machine).
	Can use sockets to talk to another process in the same machine

getting a FD to a file
	open(<filename>, <flags>);

gethostbyname() technically obsolete, but francisco still uses it since he doesnt like the
	alternatives

getting a FD in general
	constructionFunction(<resourceName>, <options>...);

socket types
	client:
		can connect
		can read/write bytes

	server:
		cannot connect
		cannot read/write bytes
		
		can only receive connections requests (from client sockets)
			but it returns a client-type socket that allows the server to
			communicate back with the client side
		
C = client socket; O = server socket; ^ = arrow up
	 client			server
	|   C	| ------------>	|   S  	|
	|   ^ 	| <------------	|   C   |

accept is a blocking call. Thus, if accepting, cant use other sockets within the same thread of control
instead, use multiple processes/threads to manage multiple sockets
	one thread per socket

Steps to build the different types of sockets:
client
	socket()
	connect()
	start reading/writing to that socket
	
server
	socket()
	bind() <-- binds the socket to a specific port
	listen() <---set up machine to "listen" for connections
	accept() <---"listens" for connections

ip addres: points to a machine
port number: points to a process on a machine
default ports for:
	http: 80
	ssh: 22
	dns: 52
	scp: 23
