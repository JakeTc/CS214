	presentation	taking data and "polish" it (i.e. decompress, decrypt, formatting, etc.)
	session		synchronization over multiple sockets/ enforce rules over multiple messages
	transport	Messaging and Quality of Service/ efficiency/ differential delivery. (i.e. sockets/ports/data channel)
	networking	routing(indirect connection)
	data link	get fr/ point A to point B/ direct connection (bandwidth)
	physical	bits to radiation and vice versa
	
	Whenever data goes through the layers, extra data is added/subtracted from it in the form of headers or footers
